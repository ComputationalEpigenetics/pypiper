Making robust pipelines just got easier. Pypiper helps you take your current pipeline and make it better with minimal effort on your part. 

Pypiper is a lightweight python toolkit for gluing together restartable, robust
command line pipelines. With Pypiper, simplicity is paramount. A new user can start building pipelines using Pypiper in under 15 minutes. Learning all the :doc:`features and  benefits <features>` of Pypiper takes just an hour or two. At the same time, Pypiper provides immediate and significant advantages over a simple shell script.

To get started, proceed with the :doc:`Introduction <intro>` or use the table of contents below to navigate the docs. When you have a feel for what Pypiper is, the best way to learn is by looking at the :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials>`. That should get you started building your first pipeline. But before you get too deep, make sure you get the most out Pypiper by checking out the :doc:`Advanced Functions <advanced>` and :doc:`Best Practices <best-practices>` for building pipelines.

Sister projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Pypiper <http://pypiper.readthedocs.io/>`_ and `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_ work together as a comprehensive pipeline management system. `Pypiper <http://pypiper.readthedocs.io/>`_ builds individual, single-sample pipelines that can be run one sample at a time. `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_ then processes groups of samples, submitting appropriate pipelines to a cluster or server. The two projects are independent and can be used separately, but they are most powerful when combined.
