Pypiper helps you produce pipelines.

Pypiper is a lightweight python toolkit for gluing together restartable, robust
command line pipelines. With Pypiper, simplicity is paramount. Our goal is that
a user could start building useful pipelines using the system in under 15 minutes.
Learning all the possible functions, capabilities, and benefits of Pypiper should
take under an hour. At the same time, using Pypiper should provide immediately clear
and significant advantages over a simple bash script.
