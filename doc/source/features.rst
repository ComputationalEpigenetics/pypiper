Features
=========================
Pypiper provides the following benefits:

-   **Restartability:** Commands check for their targets and only run if the target needs to be created, much like a `makefile`, making the pipeline pick up where it left off in case it needs to be restarted or extended.
-   **Pipeline integrity protection:** PyPiper uses file locking to ensure that multiple pipeline runs will not interfere with one another -- even if the steps are identical and produce the same files. One run will seemless wait for the other, making it possible to share steps seemlessly across pipelines.
-   **Memory use monitoring:** Processes are polled for high water mark memory use, allowing you to more accurately guage your future memory requirements.
-   **Easy job status monitoring:** Pypiper uses status flag files to make it possible to assess the current state (`running`, `failed`, or `completed`) of hundreds of jobs simultaneously.
-   **Robust error handling:** Pypiper closes pipelines gracefully on interrupt or termination signals, converting the status to `failed`. By default, a process that returns a nonzero value halts the pipeline, unlike in bash, where by default the pipeline would continue using an incomplete or failed result. This behavior can be overridden as desired with a single parameter.
-   **Logging:** Pypiper automatically records the output of your pipeline and its subprocesses, and provides copious information on pipeline initiation, as well as easy timestamping.
-   **Easy result reports:** Pypiper provides functions to put key-value pairs into an easy-to-parse stats file, making it easy to summarize your pipeline results.
-   **Simplicity:** It should only take you 15 minutes to run your first pipeline. The basic documentation is just a few pages long. The codebase itself is also only a few thousand lines of code, making it very lightweight.


Furthermore, Pypiper includes a suite of commonly used pieces of code (toolkits) which the user may use to build pipelines.
