Basic tutorial
*****************

Now, download `basic.py <https://github.com/epigen/pypiper/blob/master/example_pipelines/basic.py>`_ and run it with `python basic.py` (or, better yet, make it executable (`chmod 755 basic.py`) and then run it directly with `./basic.py`). This example is a documented vignette; so just read it and run it to get an idea of how things work.
