=========================

-   **How can I run my pipeline on more than 1 sample?** Pypiper only handles individual-sample pipelines. To run it on multiple samples, you need `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_. Dividing multi-sample handling from individual sample handling is a conceptual advantage that allows us to write a nice, universal, generic sample-handler that you only have to learn once.
-   **What cluster resources can pypiper use?** PyPiper is compute-agnostic. You run it wherever you want; If you want a nice way to submit pipelines for samples any cluster manager, check out `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_.
