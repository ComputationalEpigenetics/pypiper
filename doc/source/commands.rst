Commands
=========================

The key things you need to know that the ``PipelineManager`` can do are:

.. currentmodule:: pypiper.pypiper.PipelineManager
.. autosummary:: 
	start_pipeline
	run
	stop_pipeline


With that you can create a simple pipeline.

Complete specifications for these and the more advanced functions can be found in the :doc:`API <api>`.
