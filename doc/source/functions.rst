Pypiper Functions
=========================

Pypiper is simple, but powerful. You only need 3 functions to get started. ``PipelineManager`` can do:

.. currentmodule:: pypiper.pypiper.PipelineManager
.. autosummary:: 
	start_pipeline
	run
	stop_pipeline


With that you can create a simple pipeline. You can click on each function to view the in-depth documentation for that function. There are quite a few optional parameters to the ``run`` function, which is where most of Pypiper's power comes from

When you've mastered the basics and are ready to get more powerful, add in a few new (optional) commands that make debugging and development easier:

.. autosummary:: 
	clean_add
	report_result
	get_stat
	timestamp


The complete documentation for these functions can be found in the :doc:`API <api>`.
